# CF limitations for satellite data
1. 
The PDF file lists three limitations in the current CF for satellite swath and grid files. The original satellite files are in HDF formats and can be found under
ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/pub/outgoing/ymuqun/earth-cube/Satellite/ .

2. 
I also provide a converted netCDF-4 file for NASA Cloud Absorption Radiometer(CAR) products. It is similar to CF DSG trajectory profiler. However, physically it is not a profiler. It seems a trajectory of angles satellite takes on earth. This demonstrates the current CF DSG description is not sufficient to describe some satellite DSG products. car-dim.nc4.hdr is the CDL header file. The original and the converted netCDF-4 file can be found under ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/pub/outgoing/ymuqun/earth-cube/DSG/sat/ .
