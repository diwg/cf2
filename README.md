# CF2

There are multiple efforts to extend the Climate-Forecast (CF) metadata convention.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports the EarthCube "Advancing netCDF-CF for the Geoscience Community" [project](https://github.com/Unidata/EC-netCDF-CF) that organizes some of these efforts.
Project members have gathered scientific use-cases and example datasets (such as [these](https://github.com/diwg/diwg) to guide the drafting of documents detailing enhancements to the CF standard.
Since some of the enhancements break backwards compatibility with CF, this effort is loosely known as "CF2", although no formal relation between CF2 and CF yet exists.
One important proposed extension to CF the Swath proposal, more formally "Encoding of Swath Data in the Climate and Forecast Convention". It is available (here)[https://github.com/Unidata/EC-netCDF-CF/blob/master/swath/swath.adoc].
Another important CF2 proposal is the Group proposal, more formally "CF2-Group: Draft Extension for Files with Groups". It is stored in this repository.
Also located in this repository, at the bottom of this page, are notes on Discrete Sampling Geometries taken at the CF2 meeting in September, 2017.

CF2-Group: Draft Extension for Files with Groups

## Previous Work

The earliest pertinent discussions to utilizing Groups in CF2 were conducted as part of NASA Dataset Interoperability Working Group (DIWG) efforts dating back to 2013:

These efforts migrated to the EarthCube project from 2015-2018, when the CF2-Group draft proposal was collaboratively shared as a Google Doc:

Prior to its final submission to the CF list in April, 2018, the CF2-Group proposal was converted to AsciiDoc and is hosted here, in this repository.

# CF2 and Discrete Sampling Geometries

### Report from CF2.0+ Workshop
#### Goal:
- Identify which aspects of the enhanced data model would be most beneficial for DSG data
- Develop some concrete steps for implementation of those aspects in CF2.0


#### Discussed the following use cases:
- Argo floats - A ship drops a float which drifts with currents and measures parameters at various depths. Folks might request by buoy number, time slice, spatial coordinates
- Swath - NCEI has swath template, but there isnâ€™t a standard feature type for swaths.
- Time aggregate CTD casts, serve with THREDDS with netCDF subsetting service
- Sensor measures at high frequency (burst or event data), summarized/event data computed for users (see below)

#### Possibilities available via netCDF enhanced model
- Groups, e.g., make a different group for each sample location with a uniquely sized temperature dimension in each group
- VLEN (variable length arrays), e.g., make a vlen temperature dimension

#### DAP discussion and some questions/conclusions:
- Should CF be involved in specifying a **query and delivery system?**
DSG files can be accessed via cdmremote
- what about more generic  simple flat, tables based (SQL-like) query API regardless of underlying data structure.  
- Declarative language - specify what you want, not how to do it. It could greatly simplify requesting subsets of data from a wide variety of underlying data structures.

#### Action items:
- Unidata and others to prototype access of a representational datasets
  - Represent it using groups and VLEN to benchmark access and use performance


- Charlie and others to prototype using groups for metadata for ARGO floats
  - Document what would it take to make that file CF2.0 compliant
  - How does this file become discoverable?  (ie, group data have to repeated?)
  - Does the enhanced metadata actually improve workflow?


- There is a need for tools and conventions that help the community of spreadsheet-using scientists to become part of our CF community.  
    - A set of simple conventions describing how column headers (including units) are specified
    - A set of simple conventions describing how global attributes can be represented in a CSV header
    - Tools that bi-directionally convert between CSV and netCDF-CF DSG (with no information loss) can easily be built.
    - Some candidate tools already exist:  Rosetta, and Panoply
