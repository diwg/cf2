# CF2

There are multiple efforts to extend the Climate-Forecast (CF) metadata convention.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports the EarthCube "Advancing netCDF-CF for the Geoscience Community" [project](https://github.com/Unidata/EC-netCDF-CF) that organizes some of these efforts.
Project members have gathered scientific use-cases and example datasets (such as [these](https://github.com/diwg/diwg) to guide the drafting of documents detailing enhancements to the CF standard.
Since some of the enhancements break backwards compatibility with CF, this effort is loosely known as "CF2", although no formal relation between CF2 and CF yet exists.
One important proposed extension to CF the Swath [proposal](https://github.com/Unidata/EC-netCDF-CF/blob/master/swath/swath.adoc), more formally "Encoding of Swath Data in the Climate and Forecast Convention".
Another important CF2 proposal is the Group [proposal](https://github.com/diwg/cf2/blob/master/group/cf2-group.adoc), more formally "CF2-Group: Draft Extension for Files with Groups".
Also in this repository, at the bottom of this page, are notes on Discrete Sampling Geometries taken at the CF2 meeting in September, 2017.

# CF2-Group

## Current Draft

[CF2-Group: Draft Extension for Files with Groups](https://github.com/diwg/cf2/blob/master/group/cf2-group.adoc)

## Previous Work

Earlier discussions and proposal drafts for utilizing Groups in CF2 are still viewable for their historical provenance.
These efforts were conducted as part of NASA Dataset Interoperability Working Group (DIWG) and date back to 2013:

Original [proposal](http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/pipermail/cf-metadata/2013/056827.html) to CF list, September 15, 2013

This effort migrated to the EarthCube project from 2015-2018, when the CF2-Group draft proposal was collaboratively shared.
